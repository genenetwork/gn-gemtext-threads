In this document we will track tasks based of our weekly meetings. This list sets the agenda
on progress for the next week's meeting.

## 20-01-2024
### @bonfacem

* [ ] Report:    OpenAI on Aider - use AI for programming - discuss with @alexm

=> https://issues.genenetwork.org/topics/ai/aider

* [-] Metadata:  Provide list of case attributes for BXD to @flisso
* [-] Code UI:   GeneRIF and GenWiki should work from the mapping page - encourage people to use
                 - anyone logged in can edit
                 - If RIF does not exist point to GeneWiki
                 - If GeneWiki does not exist provide edit page
* [ ] Code export: Exporting traits to lmdb PublishData - @alexm helps with SQL
                 - missing data should not be an X
                 - run lmdb design (first code) by @pjotrp
                 - start exporting traits for Johannes (he will need to write a python reader)
* Later:         Improve the work/dev container for @alexm

### @flisso

* [ ] Write:  Uploader protocol.  NOTES: Finished with C-elegans.  Yet to test with other datasets.
* [ ] Script: Run Reaper
* [ ] Data:  Case attributes - with @bonfacem
* [ ] Write:  Create protocol to upload case attributes

### @alexm

* [ ] Code: Rqtl2 match Rqtl1: match scan changes.  Notes: PR out and added tests.
* [ ] Bug:  Fix pair scan.  NOTES: Fixed it.  But can't test it now since CD is down.
* Later: AI changes

### Pjotr

* [ ] Code: Work on precompute with GEMMA (w. Jameson)
* [ ] Code: Take Bonface's trait files when they become available


## 27-01-2024

Last week's error with CD and production downtime:
- [ level 1] Container: Error messages when data not loaded in Virtuoso, Indexing.
- [ level 2] Sheepdog: Check services --- sheepdog.  Health checkpoints.
- [ level 3] User feedback.  Escalate errors correctly to the users.


### @Bonz
* [ ] Troubleshoot CD.
* [ ] Export files in lmdb.  Yohannes read file in Python
* [ ] Metadata:  Provide list of case attributes for BXD to @flisso
* [ ] Aider: See if it can generate some guile and python.  Give an example.

### @alexm
* [ ] UI for R/Qtl2.

### @flisso
* [ ] Look at Fre'd Python code for the uploader and report on this.

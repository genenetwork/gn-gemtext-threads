** MONTH OCTOBER, 2025  
*** Metric wise, plans and goals to achieve 

** 1. Bonface
=> CD/CI, tests/infra is super stable 
=> Upgrades that affect CD 
=> Support work for GNQA; Review Johannes' work, GPU-makes sense, fahamu ai, playing catch up (cover up knowledge gap)
=> follow up on my phd 

** 2. Alex 
=> Rqtl2 lmdb adapter running on production; depends on traction with Rqtl2 upstream  by karl Browman to gn-bioinformatics
=> Collaborate with Felix on his scripts 

** 3. Johannes
=> Experimenting on the qtl data with the AI system being currently built; also in need of optimization 
=> Comparing LLMs/GNQA agents; getting assistance from Shelby's work 

** 4. Felix 
=> HS genotypes to be fully supported in GN2 
=> Poster presentation 
=> PhD
  => ML objective (ML fundamentals)
  => Complete 1st manuscript draft 
  => Process my student pass

3. Get comfortable with programming

#### Previous week(s)

* [x] Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) - 'Traditional Phewas' - AI aspect - Johannes
* [+] Finalize the slide deck - so it can be read on its own

*     - [ ] list of relevant papers with one-liners - the WHY
=> https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3294237/
* [+] Analyse and discuss BXD case attributes with Rob --- both group level and dataset level
* [ ] Sane representation of case attributes in RDF with @bonfacem
* [X] Present C.elegans protocol and example mappings with GEMMA/Rqtl
* [ ] Uploader - setting up code with @fredm
*     - [ ] Concrete improvement to work on
*     - [X] run small database mysql locally
*     - [X] aider with Sonnet + code fixes
*     - [ ] document - add to code base - merge with Fred's tree - share changes with Pjotr & team
* [ ] Sort @alexm application with Pwani = this week

### This week (07-04-2025 onwards) 

* GN2 tasks 
  * [ X ] Progress on Kilifish 
        - meet with Dennis (send him an email with all the queries needed) 
        - progress to format and upload data to gn2 (to be ready by latest Friday!) 
  * [ X ] Make a milestone with genotype smoothing 

* PhD tasks 
  * [ X ] Complete and share concept note and timeline to supervisors, have a meeting for progress 
  * [ ] Make a milestone on chapter one manuscript (deep dive into the selected papers){THE BIG PICTURE; a complete draft by early May} 

* Programming 
  * [ ] Make a milestone with the uploader (really push and learn!) 
         - documentation (use ai); add to the code base of the uploader  
         - utilise the hurdles to learn programming priniciples in action 

### This week (14-04-2025 onwards)  

* gn-uploader programming
  * [X] - Resolve the config file issue with your local uploader
  * [ ] - Run the uploader locally, then break the system, see how components connect to each other
  * [ ] - document your findings

* genotype smoothing
  * [ ] - resolve errors with plotting, document your findings

### This week (21-04-Onwards) 

* genotype smoothing
 * [ ] - haplotyping tools for smoothing (plink,., etc)
         - see what it can offer with smoothing. See what others say about this.

* gn-uploader programming
 * [ ] - Run the uploader locally, then break the system, see how components connect to each other (ask help from Bonz)
  * [ ] - document your findings


* AOBs 
  * [ X ] Weekly meetings 
  * [ X ] follow up with Paul on his progress 
  * [ X ] follow up on the MSc bioinformatics project 
  * [ X ] follow up on Alex's application with Pwani 

### Later weeks

* [ ] Kilifish into GN
* [ ] Review paper on genotyping
* [ ] HS Rat
* [ ] Prepare others for C.elegans
* [ ] Upload Arabidopsis dataset
* [ ] Upload Medaka dataset
* [ ] Work on improved DO and Ce genotyping

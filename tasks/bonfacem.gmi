## Tasks

### Note
* Don't lose metadata.   Have an array of disabled snips.
* Store by snip (rows).  Storage by marker.  2 different files.
* gn-auth:
  have wrappers around gn-auth (draw-back: folk may forget).
  use Nginx as a MTM (re-routing calls).  How to add handler in Nginx and to work with tokens.
* GN-auth dashboard fixes.  Follow up with Fred.
* Case-attributes used in co-variates.

### PhD Work

* Concept note/ideas: Add all metadata in GN to an LLM that enriches GnQA.
* Use mapping output as full vectors for gpt/transformers.  Integrate this work into GN.
* Share PhD concept note with PJ for polishing

### This week
* [ ] Generate RDF docs using AI.
* [~] Dump all genotypes from tux02 to LMDB.
*     - PJ sync tux01 genotypes with tux02/04.
*     - Yet to set-up 2FA on new device
* [~] Look at deep-seek/anthropic (also really doc deployment in balg01).  Run in debian machine.
* [~] Set-up wolfshead.
* [~] Adapter to LMDB into a cross object.
*     - Try computations with R/qtl2.
*     - Look at R LMDB libraries.
*     - Look at functions that read the files.
*     - PJ: LMDB adapter in R and cross-type files.
* [~] gn-guile webhook.


### Later
* [ ] Editing genotype metadata
* [+] Correlations hash.
*     - Add dataset count to RDF.
* [ ] Spam + LLMs
*     - RateLimiting for Rif Editing.
*     - Honepot approach.
* [ ] Dockerise GN container.   For Harm.
* [ ] Send emails when job fail.
* [ ] Look at updating gn-auth/gn-libs to PYTHONPATH for gn2/3.
* [ ] Sample/individual/strain/genometype counts for PublishData only - ProbeSetData? https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/blob/testing/scripts/sample_count.py - mirror in RDF and use global search
*     - search for all traits that have more than X samples
* [ ] Add case attributes to RDF and share with Felix (depends on @felixl)
* [ ] xapian search, add dataset size keys, as well as GN accession id, trait id, and date/year
*     - Improve xapian markdown docs to show all used fields/keys with examples
*     - genewiki search (link in table? check with Rob)
*     - base line with GN1 search - add tests
*     - Fix missing search term for sh* - both menu search and global search
*     - Use GN1 as a benchmark for search results (mechanical Rob?)
*     - Xapian ranges for markers

### Even later

* [ ] Rest API for precompute output (mapping with GEMMA)
* [ ] GNQA add GN metadata (to RAG)
*     - Focus on RIF
*     - triple -> plain text
*     - bob :fatherof nancy -> Bob is the father of Nancy.

## Later

* [ ] AI improvements

*     1. Running AI server using (our) VPS and our tokens
*        + Pjotr gives API key - OpenAI - model?
*     2. Read the code base - Elixir is plumbing incl. authentication, Python processing text etc.
*     3. Try ingestion and prompt (REST API) - check out postgres tables
*     4. Backup state from production Elixir

*     - NOTE: Elpy broke.  Eglot/lspemacs doesn't work.
*     - NOTE: Moved away from storing diffs in files to LMDB.
*     - Error when checking the history.  Fixed by fixing the diffs.

- Referrer headers -- a way of preventing bots beyond rate-limiting. 

### This week
* [ ] LMDB database.
*     - Simplify (focus on small files).  Don't over-rely on Numpy.

### Later

* [ ] Send emails when job fail.
* [ ] Look at updating gn-auth/gn-libs to PYTHONPATH for gn2/3.
* [ ] Sample/individual/strain/genometype counts for PublishData only - ProbeSetData? https://github.com/genenetwork/genenetwork2/blob/testing/scripts/sample_count.py - mirror in RDF and use global search
*     - search for all traits that have more than X samples
* [ ] Add case attributes to RDF and share with Felix (depends on @felixl)
* [ ] xapian search, add dataset size keys, as well as GN accession id, trait id, and date/year
*     - Improve xapian markdown docs to show all used fields/keys with examples
*     - genewiki search (link in table? check with Rob)
*     - base line with GN1 search - add tests
*     - Fix missing search term for sh* - both menu search and global search
*     - Use GN1 as a benchmark for search results (mechanical Rob?)
*     - Xapian ranges for markers

### Even later

* [ ] Rest API for precompute output (mapping with GEMMA)
* [ ] GNQA add GN metadata (to RAG)
*     - Focus on RIF

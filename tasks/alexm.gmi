# Tasks for Alex

## Description

These are the tasks and issues to be handled by Alex.

Here are all open issues
=> https://issues.genenetwork.org/search?query=is%3Aopen+AND+assigned%3Aalexm&type=all

The search used for the list above is
> is:open AND assigned:alexm

You can refine the search by constraining the checks some more, e.g. to get high-priority issues

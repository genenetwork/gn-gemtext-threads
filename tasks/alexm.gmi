# Tasks for Alex

## Description

These are the tasks and issues to be handled by Alex.

Here are all open issues
=> https://issues.genenetwork.org/search?query=is%3Aopen+AND+assigned%3Aalexm&type=all

The search used for the list above is
> is:open AND assigned:alexm

You can refine the search by constraining the checks some more, e.g. to get high-priority issues

> is:open AND assigned:alexm AND priority:high

* [x] no login for gnqna
* [-] hsrat rqtl2 integration: follow up on the dumping genotypes files to lmdb 


## 16/06/2025

* [] implementation for  no login  for gnqa users.
 see issue here: https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/gnqa/implement-no-login-requirement-for-gnqa
* [] hsrat rqtl2 integration: follow up on the dumping genotypes files to lmdb with bons 
* [] create rqtl2 adapter for reading cross from  lmdb 


## 23/06/2025

*  []  focus on documentation/source code  for read cross  ;;add option for reading lmdb
*  []  looking at thor an lmdb interface
*  [x] implementation of no login for gnqna users ;; TODO push this code to cd. 


## Next week(s)

* [ ] Accelerate Xapian functionality - needs Aider key from Pjotr
* Check and fix CTL?
* [+] Create terminal output for external processes (Rqtl1, Rqtl2, pair-scan are done --- WGCNA as a pilot, with @bonfacem and @pjotrp)
* [X] GNQA says there are no results, but has them
* [X] Correlations are slow

## Done

* [X] Rqtl1 - ITP output - 3K individuals - family file
* [X] When bonz is ready wire up GNQA
*     + balg-qa.genenetwork.org
* [X] Don't support new PIL - stick to the old one in guix-bioninformatics
* [X] Make GNQA reliable (with @fahamu)
* [X] Improve UX for GNQA (with @shelbys) -- Adrian wants to use our AI UX for their setup
* [X] GNQA add abstracts pubmed (with @shelbys)
=> ../issues/fetch-pubmed-references-to-gnqa
* [X] Edit markdown/gemtext pages through web UI (with @bonfacem)

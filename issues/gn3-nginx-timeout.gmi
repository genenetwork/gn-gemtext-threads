# GN3 NGINX Timeout

## Description

The issue is that some requests to the GN3 API result in an nginx 504 Gateway Time-out error. This may not necessarily be a bug, but encountering a request timeout within 30 seconds is a short timeframe. Previously, we had a related issue where the Gunicorn server would timeout. A fix was introduced by increasing the timeout.

For reference, see the issue:
=> issues/cd-gn3-configurations

An example is when querying the Fahamu API to get non-empty results; one might have to wait up to 2 minutes. To test this on CD:

```bash
curl --json @json_data.txt https://cd.genenetwork.org/api3/llm/gnqna
```

The JSON file:

```json
"querygnqa": "describe what genetics are"
```

Results:

```html
<head><title>504 Gateway Time-out</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>504 Gateway Time-out</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>
</body>

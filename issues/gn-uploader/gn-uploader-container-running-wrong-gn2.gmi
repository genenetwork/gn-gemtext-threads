## Description

I build the uploader container with Genenetwork2, commit b9e04ad, as shown:

```
$ guix gc -R /usr/local/bin/genenetwork-uploader-container | grep genenetwork2
/gnu/store/8m0jx05b1j029iklfvy64ipjpyk6jhnz-genenetwork2-3.11-4.b9e04ad
/gnu/store/y8vsv4r22lw9f76hk418sik56vzbhpzk-gunicorn-genenetwork2-pola-wrapper
/gnu/store/g0w06f0bk0nb53phj5lp0wh8nlkf4ckn-shepherd-gunicorn-genenetwork2.scm
/gnu/store/jf02yvzvlc4nk204qgl9jxk754r9s7v8-shepherd-gunicorn-genenetwork2.go
```

However, when I look at the logs, it seems the container is instead running the code under

```
/gnu/store/2qhgkf5j649kv57nw4lzsbwlnb1790vq-profile/
```

instead, which seems to be stuck on an older commit without fixes for a circular import bug I'd fixed.

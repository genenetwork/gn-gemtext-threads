## Description

Currently, the uploader simply fails when it encounters unknown strains in the files being uploaded.

This issue will track the implementation of a system to allow the upload of strains, and the grouping of said strains into populations/tissue etc.

## TODO

* [x] UI to select species
* [x] UI to select or create a grouping for the strains (think InbredSet)
* [x] UI to select the CSV file with the strains data
* [x] UI to select the way to interprete the CSV file
* [x] Code to insert the new strains, into the database

## Description

If a user is uploading a particularly large file, we might need to provide a way for the user to resume their upload of the file.

Maybe this can wait until we have
=> /issues/gn-uploader/link-authentication-authorisation linked authentication/authorisation to gn-uploader.
In this way, each upload can be linked to a specific user.

### TODOs

* [x] Build UI to allow uploads
* [x] Build back-end to handle uploads
* [x] Handle upload failures/errors
* [x] Deploy to staging

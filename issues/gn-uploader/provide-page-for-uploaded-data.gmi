## Description

Once a user has uploaded their data, provide them with a landing page/dashboard for the data they have uploaded, with details on what that data is.

* Should we provide a means to edit the data here (mostly to add metadata and the like)?
* Maybe the page should actually be shown on GN2?

## Blockers

Depends on

## Close as complete

Current uploader directs user to a view of the data they uploader on GN2. This is complete.

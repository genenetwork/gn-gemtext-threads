## Tasks

* [X] Fix collection encoding issue

* [X] Don't import empty collections (like the Default Collection)

* [X] Update/Creation dates aren't listed for collections

* [ ] Remove in-between ticks for Effect Size Plot (from mapping page) so it's just -1/0/1

* [ ] Also make Effect Size Plot more narrow

* [ ] Prevent X/Y-aix summary text from extending beyond the graph width

* [ ] Longer tick markers as well

* [X] Remove triangle for phenotype mapping

* [X] Remove ProbeSetPosition from mapping for traits with no position

* [X] Make Haplotype legend image thicker + change text to Haplotypes (Mat, Pat, Het, Unknown)

* [X] Change "Sequence Site" in legend to "Gene Location"

* [ ] When adding genotype marker as covariate (for scatter-plot, maybe also mapping), change description to Position instead of "undefined"

* [ ] Check Add Covariation colorbox popup on Apple laptop (it shows up weird for Rob, but normal for me)

# Prompt As UI

* assigned: bonfacem, johannesm
* status: in-progress

## Description

* New search page with ChatGPT-esque ux customised for GN that presents significant hits and metadata.  Goal: better ux search experience for GN users.  Feed metadata.   Move away from xapian syntax search to natural language, and hits should return relevant gn-links based off metadata.
* Build agent/model to improve GN AI experience (related to above).
* Add pre-compute hits (already in RDF) when available.

## Tasks

* [ ] (bonfacem) Share existing TTL files with JoM.  TTL files will be used by JoM to build English sentences that can be used when building out system level prompts.
* [ ] (johannesm) Work on system level prompts based off above prompts.   Focus on phenotype data for now.   Test locally.
* [ ] (johannesm, bonfacem) Extend above to phenotypes, molecular traits and genotypes.
* [ ] (johannesm, bonfacem) REST API for processing answers from AI processing.
* [ ] (johannes, bonfacem) UI work to integrate above search in GN mainline.   No auth (security: use secret keys, setting up auth - maybe - for later).

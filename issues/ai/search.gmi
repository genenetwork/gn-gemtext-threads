# Prompt As UI

* assigned: bonfacem, johannesm
* status: in-progress

## Description

* New search page with ChatGPT-esque ux customised for GN that presents significant hits and metadata.  Goal: better ux search experience for GN users.  Feed metadata.   Move away from xapian syntax search to natural language, and hits should return relevant gn-links based off metadata.
* Build agent/model to improve GN AI experience (related to above).
* Add pre-compute hits (already in RDF) when available.

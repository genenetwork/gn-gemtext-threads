## Description

Modelling ProbeSet/GeneList metadata has already been completed in:

=> https://issues.genenetwork.org/issues/handling-resource-links-in-probeset-page Handling Resource Links in ProbeSet Page

=> https://issues.genenetwork.org/search?query=tag%3Avirtuoso Add GeneList to Metadata

Remaining work is to display this work in GN2.

## Resolution

Some minor updates were done to fix how gene-symbols are transformed.  See: 1ea6e2dd7655, 00d36a2c7571, 03df1227c419, 1082c5bfb802.  Similarly, when constructing some resources, the relevant parameters were url-encoded to form valid urls.  See: 4a62e1781692, 56d09222742c, and 03df1227c419 from:

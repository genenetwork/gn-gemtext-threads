* Priority: High
* status: completed, done, closed.

## Tasks

* [x] Move API Endpoint + logic code from QNQA to GN3.
* [x] Implement UI in GN2.
* [x] Add GN authentication.

## Notes

The initial code was implemented as a full MVC application. The idea is to split the codebase into an API endpoint, which should be moved to the GN3 codebase, while the UI should reside in GN2.

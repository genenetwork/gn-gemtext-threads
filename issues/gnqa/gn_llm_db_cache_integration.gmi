## Description:

This implementation task aims to enhance the performance and responsiveness of our GN-LLM (Large Language Model) system by incorporating a robust database caching mechanism. The focus will be on utilizing a database to store queries along with their corresponding answers and references, ensuring quicker retrieval and reduced computational load. Users can go back in time and see their search results at a given time.




## Task

* [x] implement endpoint for user caching 

* [x] implement UI for QNQA search

* [x] More customization features  like e.g user clearing their history

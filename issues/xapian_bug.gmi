## Description

Currently all Xapian searches that aren't just simple individual terms fail.

For example, this works (search for just "liver"):
https://genenetwork.org/gsearch?type=phenotype&terms=liver

While this fails (search for "liver AND group:BXD"):
https://genenetwork.org/gsearch?type=phenotype&terms=group%3ABXD+AND+liver

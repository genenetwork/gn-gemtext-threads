In Penguin2, genotype files are located in: /export/data/genenetwork/genotype_files/genotype.  Each genotype files has an identifier to a dataset it refers to:

```
@name:B6D2
```

Dump the above metadata in RDF.  When we transition fully to an LMDB store, update the RDF node with a pointer to the LMDB store.

# Tasks

* [ ] Provide sane CLI interface
* [X] Add --map-size 10M switch
* [X] Use lmdb files instead of dir
* [X] Find a way to open/create named DBs

Not possibleâ€”LMDB is a directory with data.mdb, by definition. For now, mgamma renames and copies files under the hood, which is not cool, but kind of works.

* [X] Move mgamma into ./bin
* [ ] Add ./bin/mgemma compatibility tool (note it is not mgamma)

## Description

Right now troubleshooting RDF endpoints as mentioned in:

=> issues/non-deterministic-gn3-setup-on-tux01.gmi

... is difficult since we return an empty result on failure.  The culprit:

```
...
    except (RemoteDisconnected, URLError) as error:
        breakpoint()
        return jsonify({})
```

## Resolution

This has been fixed in:

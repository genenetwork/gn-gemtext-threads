# genecup is currently running as root on penguin2.

Is this still true for tux02? Fixed: genecup is now running as a container so we can close this.

## Info

Currently when run using shepherd it fails like this:

guix system: warning: Consider running 'guix pull' followed by
'guix system reconfigure' to get up-to-date packages and security updates.

guile: warning: failed to install locale

A number of changes to different types of shepherd services (exec-command, make-system-constructor) still failed to actually run the container when started with `herd start genecup`. Ratspub is run from a `guix environment` rather than `guix system container` so we'll switch to that so we can go back to running all the services using shepherd.

=> https://git.genenetwork.org/efraim/shepherd-services/commit/b3c96077c2ae3ebda05eb53d81fa6e377a55132d The commit to make genecup run in a guix environment, using shepherd.

## Notes

* It is unclear if the environmental-variables in the shepherd service are carried over to the shell script, but it seems not
* Had to run 'guix pull' to update the guix tree for genecup, since the guix-bioinformatics repository had made breaking changes since the last time.

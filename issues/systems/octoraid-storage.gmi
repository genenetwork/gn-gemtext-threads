# OctoRAID

We are building machines that can handle cheap drives.

# octoraid01

This is a jetson with 4 22TB seagate-ironwolf-pro-st22000nt001-22tb-enterprise-nas-hard-drives-7200-rpm.

Unfortunately the stock kernel has no RAID support, so we simple mount the 4 drives (hosted on a USB-SATA bridge).

Stress testing:

```
cd /export/nfs/lair01
stress -v -d 1
```

Running on multiple disks the jetson is holding up well!

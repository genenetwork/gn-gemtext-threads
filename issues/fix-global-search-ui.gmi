## Description

The Global search  UI layout is broken on certain browser versions.
This issue has been reported in **Firefox Version 128.3.1**,
which was first offered to ESR channel users.
The root cause of the problem is unclear,
but after reviewing the global search UI code,
the following changes need to be implemented (see tasks below):



## Tasks

* [ ] Remove custom layout CSS and replace it with the Bootstrap layout for better uniformity and easier debugging.
* [ ] Modify the navbar to extend across the full width of the page on medium and small devices.

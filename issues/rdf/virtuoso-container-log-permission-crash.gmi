# Virtuoso Fails to Start Due to Incorrect Log File Ownership

* assigned: bonfacem
* status: closed

## Description

In CD, the virtuoso container keeps exiting and being re-spawned with the following error:

```
Thu Jan 15 2026 11:20:44 Can't open log : Permission denied
```

## Resolution

Fixed it by running (from inside the container):

```
chown virtuoso:virtuoso /var/lib/virtuoso
chmod 755 /var/lib/virtuoso
```

* closed

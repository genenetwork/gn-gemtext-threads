# Global Search Performance/Optimisation

* assigned: bonfacem, pjotrp
* status: in-progress

## Description

Global search is slow.  Search latency sits at ~30 seconds. Historically, identical queries completed within 1–4 seconds.  Root cause unclear, maybe hardware problems.

Performance appears to have returned to normal without code changes.

## Tasks

* [ ] Compare CD with prod wrt latency.  See if hardware is really the problem.
* [ ] Check out query plans and execution paths for global search (xapian delve, fall-back sql, weaved in gnqna)
* [ ] Doc performance.

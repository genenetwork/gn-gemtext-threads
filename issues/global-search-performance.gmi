# Global Search Performance/Optimisation

* assigned: bonfacem, pjotrp

## Description

Global search is slow.  Search latency sits at ~30 seconds. Historically, identical queries completed within 1–4 seconds.  Root cause unclear, maybe hardware problems.

Performance appears to have returned to normal without code changes.

## Tasks

* [X] Compare CD with prod wrt latency.  See if hardware is really the problem.
* [X] Check out query plans and execution paths for global search (xapian delve, fall-back sql, weaved in gnqna)
* [-] Doc performance.

After fixing a permissions issue in the Laminar CI environment (/var/guix/profiles/per-user/laminar):

...  by (inside the container) running:

```
mkdir -p /var/guix/profiles/per-user/laminar
chown -R laminar:laminar /var/guix/profiles/per-user/laminar
```

...  the CI progressed further but now fails when attempting to build guix-past.  The failure is caused by an unbound variable error for the module (libchop), indicating a mismatch or missing dependency in the pinned Guix channels.

Error Log:

```
(exception unbound-variable (value #f)
 (value "Unbound variable: ~S")
 (value (libchop)) (value #f))

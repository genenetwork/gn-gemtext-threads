## Description

Rendering images linked within markdown documents does not work as expected â€” we cannot render images if they have a relative path.
As an example see the commit below:
=> https://github.com/genenetwork/gn-docs/commit/783e7d20368e370fb497974f843f985b51606d00

In that commit, we are forced to use the full github uri to get the images to load correctly when rendered via gn-guile. This, has two unfortunate consequences:

* It makes editing more difficult, since the user has to remember to find and use the full github URL for their images.
* It ties the data and code to github

This needs to be fixed, such that any and all paths relative to the markdown file are resolved at render time automatically.

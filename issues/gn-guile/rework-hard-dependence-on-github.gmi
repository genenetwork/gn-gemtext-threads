## Description

Currently, we have a hard-dependence on Github for our source repository â€” you can see this in lines 31, 41, 55 and 59 of the code linked below:

=> https://git.genenetwork.org/gn-guile/tree/web/view/markdown.scm?id=0ebf6926db0c69e4c444a6f95907e0971ae9bf40

The most likely reason is that the "edit online" functionality might not exist in a lot of other popular source forges.

This is rendered moot, however, since we do provide a means to edit the data on Genenetwork itself. We might as well get rid of this option, and only allow the "edit online" feature on Genenetwork and stop relying on its presence in the forges we use.

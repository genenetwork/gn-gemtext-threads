## Description

The container's temporary directories should be in a large partition on the host to avoid a scenario where the writes fill up one of the smaller drives.

Currently, we use the `/tmp` directory by default, but we should look into transitioning away from that â€” `/tmp` is world readable and world writable and therefore needs careful consideration to keep safe.

Thankfully, we are running our systems within a container, and can bind the container's `/tmp` directory to a non-world-accessible directory, keeping things at least contained.

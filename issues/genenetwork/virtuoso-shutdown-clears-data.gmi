## Description

It seems that virtuoso has the bad habit of clearing data whenever it is stopped/restarted.

This issue will track the work necessary to get the service behaving correctly.

According to the documentation on
=> https://vos.openlinksw.com/owiki/wiki/VOS/VirtBulkRDFLoader the bulk loading process

```
The bulk loader also disables checkpointing and the scheduler, which also need to be re-enabled post bulk load
```

That needs to be handled.

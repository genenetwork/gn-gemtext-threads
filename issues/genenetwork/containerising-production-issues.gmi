## Description

We have recently got production into a container and deployed it: It has come up, however, that there are services that are useful to get a full-featured GeneNetwork system running that are not part of the container.

This is, therefore, a meta-issue, tracking all issues that relate to the deployment of the disparate services that make up GeneNetwork.

## Documentation

=> https://issues.genenetwork.org/topics/genenetwork/genenetwork-services

The link above documents the various services that make up the GeneNetwork service.

## Issues

* [ ] Move user directories to a large partition
* [ ] Link TMPDIR in container to a directory on a large partition

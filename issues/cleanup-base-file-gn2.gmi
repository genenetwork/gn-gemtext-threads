# Cleanup GN2 Base HTML File

## Tags

* Assigned: alexm
* Keywords: base, HTML, JavaScript, cleanup
* type: Refactoring
* Status: In progress

## Description

The base file should contain no custom JavaScript since it is inherited in almost all files in GN2. It should only include what is necessary. As a result, we need to move the global search from the base file to the index page, which renders the GN2 home.

## Tasks

* [] Remove global search code from the base file and move it to the index page
* [] Fix formatting and linting issues in the base file (e.g., tags)
* []  Inherit from index page for all gn2 templates


## Notes

See the PR that seeks to fix this:

## Notes 26/09/2024

It was agreed that global search should be a feature for all pages,
As such all files need to inherit from the global search which
defines the global search.

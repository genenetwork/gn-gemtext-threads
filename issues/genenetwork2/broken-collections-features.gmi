# Broken Collections Features

## Tags

* type: bug
* status: open
* priority: high
* assigned: zachs, fredm
* keywords: gn2, genenetwork2, genenetwork 2, collections

## Descriptions

There are some features in the search results page, and/or the collections page that are broken â€” these are:

* "CTL" feature
* "MultiMap" feature
* "Partial Correlations" feature
* "Generate Heatmap" feature

### Reproduce Issue

* Go to https://genenetwork.org
* Select "Mouse (Mus musculus, mm10) for "Species"
* Select "BXD Family" for "Group"
* Select "Traits and Cofactors" for "Type"
* Select "BXD Published Phenotypes" for "Dataset"
* Type "locomotion" in the "Get Any" field (without the quotes)
* Click "Search"
* In the results page, select the traits with the following "Record" values: "BXD_10050", "BXD_10051", "BXD_10088", "BXD_10091", "BXD_10092", "BXD_10455", "BXD_10569", "BXD_10570", "BXD_11316", "BXD_11317"
* Click the "Add" button and add them to a new collection
* In the resulting collections page, click the button for any of the listed failing features above

### Failure modes

* The "CTL" and "WCGNA" features have a failure mode that might have been caused by recent changes making use of AJAX calls, rather than submitting the form manually.
* The "MultiMap" and "Generate Heatmap" features raise exceptions that need to be investigated and resolved
* The "Partial Correlations" feature seems to run forever

## Break-out Issues

We break-out the issues above into separate pages to track the progress of the fixes for each feature separately.

# Description

This page attempts to document the deployment process we have for GeneNetwork. We use Guix system containers for deployment of CI/CD and the Guix configuration for the CI/CD container should be considered the authoritative reference.

## genenetwork2

To install GN2 by hand for development we also track

=> ./developing-against-gn
=> ./installation

## genenetwork3

Deployment-specific settings for genenetwork3 should be written to a configuration file and the path to that file should be set in the GN3_CONF environment variable.

Here's a typical configuration file. Please take care to customize it to your specific requirements.
```
SPARQL_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:9082/sparql"
DATA_DIR="/export/data/genenetwork"
XAPIAN_DB_PATH="/export/data/genenetwork-xapian"
```
DATA_DIR must contain two directoriesâ€”genotype_files and synteny.

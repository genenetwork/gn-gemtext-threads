# [ADR-000/gn3] Add RDF Test Cases

* author: bonfacem
* status: proposed
* reviewed-by: jnduli

## Context

We have no way of ensuring the integrity of our SPARQL queries in GN3.  As such, GN3 is fragile to breaking changes when the TTL files are updated.

## Decision

In Virtuoso, we load all our data to a default named graph: <http://genenetwork.org>.  For SPARQL/RDF tests, we should upload test ttl files to a test named graph: <http://test.genenetwork.org>, and run our end-to-end API tests against that named graph.

## Consequences

* Extra bootstrapping to load ttl files when running the test.
* Extra documentation to GN developers on how to run virtuoso locally to get the tests running.
* Testing against gn-machines to make sure that all things run accordingly.
* Extra maintenance costs to keep the TTL files in lockstep with the latest RDF changes during re-modeling.
* Improvement in GN3 reliability.

* [+] Make sure CRON works on tux01 for balg01
* [X] Make sure CRON works on tux01 for tux04
* [X] Make sure CRON works on tux01 for space
* [ ] Make sure CRON works on tb
* [ ] Create borg-borg on tb
* [ ] After borg-borg add CRON `borg prune' on tux01

## Update guix

* [X] borg extract genotype files

```
/usr/local/guix-profiles/gn-latest/bin/borg extract /export2/data/wrk/tux01/borg-genenetwork::borg-GN2-home-20240218-10:00-Sun --progress

* [ ] Check tux02 configurations

The main example lives in

# Testing performance

See the drive specs by using the identifier

```
fdisk -l
```

For disk speeds make sure there is no load and run

```
hdparm -Ttv /dev/sdc1
```

Cheap and cheerful:

Write test:

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=./test bs=512k count=2048 oflag=direct
```

Read test:

```
/sbin/sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3
dd if=./test of=/dev/zero bs=512k count=2048
```



## Networking

To check the network devices installed use

```
lshw -class network
```

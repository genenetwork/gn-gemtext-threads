## Description

This document outlines the design proposal for the re-implementation of the RQTL feature in GeneNetwork providing also  a console view to track the external process.

### Problem Definition
The current RQTL implementation requires enhancements. The core functionality remains the same: making API calls from GeneNetwork 3 (GN3). The system needs a cleaner architecture for future use, emphasizing improved error handling and a clear separation of concerns between GeneNetwork 2 (GN2) and GN3. This will involve eliminating file transfers between GN2 and GN3. Additionally, a console should be provided to users for tracking the progress of ongoing tasks.

## High-Level Design
This is divided into two major components:
* Refactor the RQTL API
* Implement a console view to track the external process

### Refactor the RQTL API
This component involves rewriting the current API to replace file transfers between GN2 and GN3 with JSON data. We will also implement tests and enhance error handling.

**Subtasks:**

- [ ] Rewrite the RQTL API endpoints
- [ ] Add unit tests for this module
- [ ] Implement better error handling for the API

### Implement a Console View to Track the External Process
This component involves creating a monitoring system to track the state of the external process and output relevant information to the user.

## Deep Dive

### Running the External Script
The RQTL implementation is in R, and we need a strategy for executing this script as an external process. This can be subdivided into several key steps:

- **Task Queue Integration**: 
  - We will utilize a task queue system (currently implemented in GN3) to manage script execution.

- **Job Submission**: 
  - Each API call will create a new job in the task queue, which will handle the execution of the R script.

- **Script Execution**: 
  - This stage involves executing the R script in a controlled environment, ensuring all necessary dependencies are loaded.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: 
  - The system will have monitoring tools to track the status of each job. Users will receive real-time updates on job progress and logs for the current task.

- **Result Retrieval**: 
  - Once the R script completes (either successfully or with an error), results will be returned to the API call.

- **Error Handling**: 
  - Better error handling will be implemented to manage potential issues during script execution. This includes capturing errors from the R script and providing meaningful feedback to users through the application.

### Additional Error Handling Considerations
This will involve:
* API error handling
* Error handling within the R script

## Additional UI Considerations
We need to rethink where to output the external process logs in the UI. Currently, we can add flags to the URL to enable this functionality, e.g., `URL/page&flags&console=1`.

### Current Design Suggestions:
#### With HTMX, offer a split screen
This will include an output page and a monitoring system page.

#### Popup button for preview
A button that allows users to preview and hide the console output.

## Long-Term Goals
We aim to run computations on clusters rather than locally. This project will serve as a pioneer for that approach.

* Status: In Progress



## Description

This document outlines the design proposal for the re-implementation of the RQTL feature in GeneNetwork providing also  a console view to track the external process.

### Problem Definition

The current RQTL implementation faces the following challenges:

- Lack of adequate error handling for the API and scripts.

- Insufficient separation of concerns between GN2 and GN3.

- lack way for user to track the progress of the r-qtl script being executed

- There is lack of a clear way in which the r-qtl script is executed

We will address these challenges and add  enhancements by:

- Rewriting the R script using r-qtl2 instead of r-qtl.

- Establishing clear separation of concerns between GN2 and GN3, eliminating file path transfers between the two.

- Implementing better error handling for both the API and the RQTL script.

- run the script as  a  job in a task queue

- Piping stdout from the script to the browser through a console for real-time monitoring.

- Improving the overall design and architecture of the system.

-  The system requires a cleaner architecture for future use.


## High-Level Design
This is divided into two major components:
* RQTL Api

* Monitoring system for the rqtl script

### RQTL Api


This component will serve as the entry point for running RQTL in GN3. At this stage, we need to improve the overall architecture and error handling. This process will be divided into the following steps:

-  Data Validation
In this step, we must validate that all required data to run RQTL is provided in the JSON format. This includes the mapping method, genotype file, phenotype file, etc. Please refer to the r-qtl2 documentation for an overview on the requirements :
=> https://rqtl.org/

-  Data Preprocessing
During this stage, we will transform the data into a format that R can understand. This includes converting boolean values to the appropriate representations, preparing the RQTL command with all required values, and adding defaults where necessary.

-  Data Computation
In this stage, we will pass the RQTL script command to the task queue to run as a job.

-   Output Data Processing
In this step, we need to retrieve the results outputted from the script in a specified format, such as JSON or CSV. This may include outputs like RQTL pair scans and generated diagrams. Please refer to the documentation for an overview:
=> https://rqtl.org/



**Subtasks:**

- [ ] Rewrite the RQTL API endpoints
- [ ] add validation and preprocessing  for data submitted from the 
- [ ]  Processing output from  the external script
- [ ] Add unit tests for this module
- [ ] Implement better error handling for the API

###  Monitoring system for the  rqtl script

This component involves creating a monitoring system to track the state of the external process and output relevant information to the user.



## Deep Dive


### Running the External Script
The RQTL implementation is in R, and we need a strategy for executing this script as an external process. This can be subdivided into several key steps:

- **Task Queue Integration**: 
  - We will utilize a task queue system (currently implemented in GN3) to manage script execution.

- **Job Submission**: 
  - Each API call will create a new job in the task queue, which will handle the execution of the R script.

- **Script Execution**: 
  - This stage involves executing the R script in a controlled environment, ensuring all necessary dependencies are loaded.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: 
  - The system will have monitoring tools to track the status of each job. Users will receive real-time updates on job progress and logs for the current task.

- **Result Retrieval**: 
  - Once the R script completes (either successfully or with an error), results will be returned to the API call.

- **Error Handling**: 
  - Better error handling will be implemented to manage potential issues during script execution. This includes capturing errors from the R script and providing meaningful feedback to users through the application.

### Additional Error Handling Considerations
This will involve:
* API error handling
* Error handling within the R script

## Additional UI Considerations
We need to rethink where to output the external process logs in the UI. Currently, we can add flags to the URL to enable this functionality, e.g., `URL/page&flags&console=1`.
Also the design suggestion is to out the results in a terminal emulator for

### Current Design Suggestions:
#### With HTMX, offer a split screen
This will include an output page and a monitoring system page.

#### Popup button for preview
A button that allows users to preview and hide the console output.



## Long-Term Goals
We aim to run computations on clusters rather than locally. This project will serve as a pioneer for that approach.
